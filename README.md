# Bioinformatics Projects

## About

A collection of personal explorations and class assignments in genomics, NGS workflows, and algorithm development. Each folder contains a self-contained project with its own code, data (or links to data), and documentation.

This repo hosts all the bioinformatics projects I’m working on—both self-driven experiments and coursework assignments. Projects span Python and R implementations, from classic algorithms (e.g. Needleman–Wunsch alignment) to real-world NGS data analyses.

## Prerequisites

Depending on the project, you’ll need:

- **Python 3.8+** (with packages listed in each project’s `requirements.txt`)  
- **R 4.0+** (with packages listed in each project’s `DESCRIPTION` or at top of the RMarkdown)  
- Basic command-line tools: `git`, `bash`, etc.
