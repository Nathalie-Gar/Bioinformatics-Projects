# Antibiotic Resistance in *E. coli* â€“ Part I: Exploratory Analysis

This project explores gene expression patterns in *E. coli* strains evolved under antibiotic pressure (GSE59408).  
The goal is to see whether expression profiles naturally separate by **antibiotic type** or by **mechanism of action (MOA)**, and to prepare the data for supervised machine learning in Part II.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Accession:** [GSE59408](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59408) (microarray expression data)  
- **Samples:** 40 resistant strains (4 replicates Ã— 10 antibiotics) + 2 parent controls  
- **Design:** Parallel laboratory evolution under single-drug selection, transcriptomes profiled post-evolution  

---

## ðŸ§ª Methods (Part I â€“ EDA)
- Variance-based filtering to keep top 2000 most variable genes  
- Standardization with `StandardScaler`  
- Dimensionality reduction:
  - PCA with scree plots, PC1â€“PC3 scatterplots  
  - UMAP (various parameters) for nonlinear visualization  
- Cluster evaluation with **silhouette scores**  
- Heatmaps of top-variance genes (averaged by drug and by MOA)

## ðŸ”Ž Results (Part I)
- **PCA & UMAP:**  
  - Antibiotic-level clustering was weak with major overlap  
  - MOA-level grouping showed clearer structure, especially for cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones  
- **Silhouette scores:**  
  - Drug-level â‰ˆ â€“0.12 â†’ poor separation  
  - MOA-level â‰ˆ â€“0.00 â†’ weak but improved  
- **Heatmaps:**  
  - By drug â†’ noisy and overlapping  
  - By MOA â†’ cleaner signatures, cephalosporins & fluoroquinolones clustered tightly

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Part II â€“ Machine Learning)
- Use PCA-reduced features to train supervised classifiers  
- Compare performance on **drug-level** vs **MOA-level** prediction  
- Evaluate models with cross-validation
