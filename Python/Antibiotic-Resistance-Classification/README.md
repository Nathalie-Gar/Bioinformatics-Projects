# Antibiotic Resistance in *E. coli* â€“ Gene Expression Classification

This project uses microarray data (GSE59408) from *E. coli* strains evolved under 10 antibiotics to explore whether gene expression patterns can be used to classify antibiotic resistance. The project is split into **two parts**:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Part I â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The first part focuses on **unsupervised analysis** to see whether resistant strains cluster naturally by antibiotic type or by mechanism of action (MOA).  
Methods used:
- Variance-based gene filtering (top 2000 most variable genes)  
- PCA with scree plots and scatterplots  
- UMAP for nonlinear visualization  
- Silhouette scores to measure cluster separability  
- Heatmaps comparing average expression profiles by **drug** vs. **MOA**  

**Key findings (Part I):**
- At the **drug level**, clustering was weak with heavy overlap (silhouette â‰ˆ â€“0.12).  
- At the **MOA level**, structure was slightly clearer (silhouette â‰ˆ 0), especially for cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones.  
- Heatmaps supported this: drug-level averages were noisy, while MOA-level averages produced coherent transcriptional signatures.  
- Overall: **mechanism of action explains more variance than drug identity, but unsupervised methods alone cannot classify the groups well.**

## ðŸ”¹ Part II â€“ Machine Learning (in progress)
The second part will focus on **supervised classification models** using PCA-reduced features:
- Train baseline models (e.g., logistic regression) at both the drug and MOA level  
- Use cross-validation to assess predictive power  
- Compare whether ML can separate antibiotics more effectively than unsupervised methods
